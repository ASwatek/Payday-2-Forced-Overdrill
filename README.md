[Payday 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/) [BLT](https://github.com/JamesWilko/Payday-2-BLT) mod that allows to activate Overdrill mode in First World Bank with a key bind instead of positioning 4 players around the vault.

I am not the original author of this mod, I just gathered a bunch of scripts around the web and made 'em into a single working mod.

Original author is [zephirot](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2-a/160411-overdrill-vault-activator.html), then there is a bit [modified version by Flexo013](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/4v8ara/payday_2_overdrill_offline/d5wbs4i/) and a [One Down fix by Boromir666](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheistmods/comments/6if259/force_overdrill_mod/) on Reddit. [Dr_Newbie](https://modworkshop.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=7573) has two more implementations to achieve this, one for [loud](https://github.com/DrNewbie/Forced-Overdrill) and one for [stealth](https://github.com/DrNewbie/Overdrill-Stealth), however first one did not work for me and as Overdrill is not supposed to be done in stealth I did not try the second one.

Requires [Announcer](https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=17623) mod.
